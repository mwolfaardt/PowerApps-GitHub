# Track issues, feedback and change request in GitHub right from your Power App.
It's really easy to integrate GitHub and PowerApps using Power Automate. Be sure to check out my blog post on [https://www.cupofdev.com/log-issues-to-github-from-a-power-app/](https://www.cupofdev.com/log-issues-to-github-from-a-power-app/) for a step by step guide on how to build a screen to capture feedback. 

If you like this idea, or would like to suggest any changes, be sure to leave me a comment in the issues tab :)
